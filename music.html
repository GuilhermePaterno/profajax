    <h3>Nirvana - Dumb </h3>
    <audio src="musica/Dumb.mp3" controls="controls"></audio>
    <br>
    I'm not like them<br>
But I can pretend<br>
The sun is gone<br>
But I have a light<br>
<br>
The day is done<br>
But I'm having fun<br>
I think I'm dumb<br>
Maybe just happy<br>
<br>
Think I'm just happy<br>
Think I'm just happy<br>
Think I'm just happy<br>
<br>
My heart is broke<br>
But I have some glue<br>
Help me inhale<br>
And mend it with you<br>

We'll flow around<br>
And hang out on clouds<br>
Then we'll come down<br>
And I have a hangover<br>

Have a hangover<br>
Have a hangover<br>
Have a hangover<br>
<br>
Skin the sun, fall asleep<br>
Wish away, the soul is cheap<br>
Lesson learned, wish me luck<br>
Soothe the burn, wake me up<br>
<br>
I'm not like them<br>
But I can pretend<br>
The sun is gone<br>
But I have a light<br>
<br>
The day is done<br>
But I'm having fun<br>
I think I'm dumb<br>
Maybe just happy<br>
<br>
Think I'm just happy<br>
Think I'm just happy<br>
Think I'm just happy<br>
<br>
I think I'm dumb<br>
I think I'm dumb<br>
I think I'm dumb<br>
I think I'm dumb<br>
<h3>Nirvana - About a Girl </h3>
<audio src="musica/About.mp3" controls="controls"></audio>
<br>
I need an easy friend<br>
I do, with an ear to lend<br>
I do think you fit this shoe<br>
I do, but you have a clue<br>
I'll take advantage while<br>
You hang me out to dry<br>
But I can't see you every night<br>
<br>
Free (I do, I do)
I'm standing in your line<br>
I do hope you have the time<br>
I do pick a number too<br>
I do keep a date with you<br>
I'll take advantage while<br>
You hang me out to dry<br>
But I can't see you every night<br>
<br>
Free
I need an easy friend<br>
I do, with an ear to lend<br>
I do think you fit this shoe<br>
I do, but you have a clue<br>
I'll take advantage while<br>
You hang me out to dry<br>
<br>
But I can't see you every night<br>
No, I can't see you every night<br>
Free<br>
I do<br>
I do<br>
I do<br>
I do<br>
<h3>Nirvana - Floyd the Barber </h3>
<audio src="musica/Floyd.mp3" controls="controls"></audio>
<br>
Bell on door clanks, come on in<br>
Floyd observes my hairy chin<br>
Sit down, chair, don't be afraid<br>
Steamed hot towel on my face<br>
<br>
I'm ashamed<br>
I'm ashamed<br>
I'm ashamed<br>
<br>
Barney ties me to the chair<br>
I can't see, I'm really scared<br>
Floyd breathes hard, I hear a zip<br>
Pee pee pressed against my lips<br>
<br>
I'm ashamed<br>
I'm ashamed<br>
I'm ashamed<br>
<br>
I sense others in the room<br>
Opie, Aunt Bea, I presume<br>
They take turns and cut me up<br>
I died smothered in Andy's clutch<br>
<br>
I'm ashamed<br>
I'm ashamed<br>
I'm ashamed<br>
